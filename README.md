# 📚 DSA and Critical Thinking

Welcome to **DSA and Critical Thinking** — a personal repository where I practice **Data Structures**, **Algorithms**, and **Problem-Solving** to strengthen my logical reasoning and programming mindset.

This repository serves as a learning log and a knowledge base for improving algorithmic thinking, mastering coding fundamentals, and preparing for technical interviews.

---

## 🚀 Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:
- Build a strong foundation in **DSA concepts**.
- Develop **critical thinking** and **analytical problem-solving skills**.
- Write **clean, optimized, and efficient** solutions.
- Track my **progress and learning journey** through consistent practice.

## 🧩 Topics Covered

The repository is organized by key DSA concepts and their typical **time complexities**:

- **Arrays and Strings** → Common operations: O(n)  
- **Linked Lists** → Traversal and insertion: O(n)  
- **Stacks and Queues** → Push/Pop/Enqueue/Dequeue: O(1)  
- **Trees and Graphs** → Traversal (DFS/BFS): O(V + E)  
- **Recursion and Backtracking** → Exponential in nature: O(2ⁿ)  
- **Searching Algorithms** → Linear: O(n), Binary Search: O(log n)  
- **Sorting Algorithms** → Quick/Merge Sort: O(n log n)  
- **Dynamic Programming** → Depends on state transitions: O(n) – O(n²)  
- **Greedy Algorithms** → Usually O(n log n)  
- **Bit Manipulation** → Constant-time operations: O(1)  
- **Mathematical and Logical Problems** → Varies per problem

## 🧠 Problem-Solving Approach

Every solution includes:
- **Problem statement** or link to the question.  
- **Step-by-step explanation** of the logic used.  
- **Time and space complexity analysis.**  
- Clean and well-commented code implementation.

## 🌱 Learning Mindset

This repository is not just about coding — it’s about **thinking deeply**, **analyzing patterns**, and **approaching problems strategically**.  
Mistakes are part of learning, and every solved problem adds one more block to becoming a better engineer.

## 🤝 Contributions

While this is primarily a personal learning repo, I’m open to:
- Discussions on optimization approaches.  
- Suggestions for new problems or techniques.  
- Code reviews and best practices.  

Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
